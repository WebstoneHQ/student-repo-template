# Webstone Education

Welcome ðŸ‘‹!

> **Warning**
> 
> Thank you for being an early adopter! This repository is a placeholder for now while we work on the final student experience.
> You can follow the progress in the [WebstoneHQ/webstone-education](https://github.com/WebstoneHQ/webstone-education/issues/29) repository.
>
> We will send you pull requests to update this repository when we're ready. You will also receive pull requests with courses, updates, and new technology stacks.

This is your [Webstone Education](https://webstone.app) learning repository. It contains lessons, quizzes and all source code for your courses. In addition, this is where you write your code as you work on individual lessons.

## Getting started

**TODO**: *Implement `pnpm start` which starts the ./app and the correct course. If multiple courses are available, let the student select the course and lesson they want to start.*

## How to learn with Webstone Education

Start the learning app with `pnpm start` and open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

**TODO**: *Implement & document where to write the code.*

## Directory structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â””â”€â”€ courses
```

### `./app`

This is the learning app accessible at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). There is no need to make any changes in this directory.

Start it with `pnpm start` in the root directory.

### `./courses`

This contains your courses. Please visit [webstone.app](https://webstone.app) to add new courses or technology stacks.

> **Note**
>
> This directory is empty by default when you sign up for Webstone Education. The Webstone team will manually open a pull request in this repository with the content of your course(s).
>
> On the bright side, work is already in progress to automate this process.

## Add new content

To add a new course or learn about a different technology stack (e.g. a Rust API rather than Node.js), please visit [webstone.app](https://webstone.app).

Once you completed the process, Webstone Education will open a pull request in this repository with the content you chose.
